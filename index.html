			<p id="Aboutme"><img id="image" src="/Users/Arus/Desktop/Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/BasicPortfolioPic.jpg" alt="Donuts" align="left"> "The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnutâ€”which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. A small spherical piece of dough may be cooked as a doughnut hole. Once doughnuts have been fried, they may be glazed with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate, or topped with powdered sugar or sprinkles or fruit. Other shapes include rings, balls, and flattened spheres, as well as ear shapes, twists and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake and yeast-risen type doughnuts. Donuts are often accompanied by coffee when they are purchased at doughnut shops or fast food restaurants."</p>
